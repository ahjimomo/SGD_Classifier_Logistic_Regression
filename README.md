# SGD_Classifier_Logistic_Regression
Deploying Logistic Regression through scikit-learn SGD Classifier

1. Project Overview:

(a) To work on multi-logistics regression methodology with regularization (penalty/weight-decay) to predict if banknotes are genuine or forged using SGD Classifier from sci-kit learn.

2. Dataset:

Banknote Authentication Dataset

3. Sources:

(a) Origin: This dataset was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

(b) Creator: University of Applied Sciences, Ostwestfalen-Lippe, volker.lohweg '@' hs-owl.de
